Queries in a config file (my recommendation)

Same as above, but instead of baking them into code, you store them in e.g. a YAML/JSON/CSV like:

- name: kommune_befolkning
  method: POST
  url: "https://.../tables/12345/data?lang=no&outputFormat=parquet"
  body: |
    { ... whatever the builder generated ... }

- name: sysselsetting
  method: POST
  url: "https://.../tables/67890/data?lang=no&outputFormat=parquet"
  body: |
    { ... }


Your R code just:

reads this config,

loops over rows,

fires the request and writes the delta tables.

✅ You still skip writing a smart query builder

✅ Easy to add/remove tables without touching code

✅ Very explicit: “this report uses exactly these queries”

❌ Less flexible for dynamic user input later (but you don’t need that yet)
